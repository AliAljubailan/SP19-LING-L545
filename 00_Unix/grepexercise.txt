in my file of Maltese, i applied the command grep '^....$' words wiki.txt | wc -w

to count 4 letter words in the file. it returned 119
==================

Looking for words with no vowels, besides numbers grep only returned this gloss from my file:

PBS.

I only looked fro Latin script vowels due to the variety of scripts in my file
============

Those were the only capital letter words in my file:
PBS.



KOTBA
ARTIKOLI

I used the command line: grep -v '[a-z]' wiki.txt , for getting this result
